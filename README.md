# Robotics-and-Mechatronics
The course projects:

Project 1: Angle recording and filtering using MPU-6050, using that as a maze game controller. Capturing motion using MediaPipe.

Project 2: Kinematics and dynamics modeling of SCARA robotic arm using Matlab and Simscape environment.

Project 3: Implementing character drawing and rotation in ROS using turtlesim, with Python scripts and launch files for automated operations.

Project 4: Developing an automated system using deep learning (YOLO v8 and Segment Anything Mode(SAM)) for object detection and segmentation to efficiently pack custom catering packages and enhance robotic manipulation.
